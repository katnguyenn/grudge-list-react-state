## Description: 

An application that lets you keep track of grudges. Users are able to add a new grudge and forgive those that have wronged them. This comes from Frontend Masters' State Management in Pure React, v2 course (https://frontendmasters.com/courses/pure-react-state/). Learned core APIs in React to handle state in both class components and React hooks, created custom hooks, used reducers and implemented Context API. 

## Concepts: 
* setState & Asynchonicity
* Persisting State & useRef
* useEffect & Cleanup
* Reducer Action, State & dispatch
* React.memo & useCallback to improve performance
* Context API to avoid prop drilling
